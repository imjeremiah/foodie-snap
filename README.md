## Project Conventions

To ensure our codebase remains clean and consistent, we adhere to a strict set of rules.

- **Directory & File Naming**: All directories are `kebab-case`. Component files are `PascalCase.tsx`.
- **Documentation**: Every file must have a header comment explaining its purpose, and every function must have a TSDoc block.
- **Styling**: All styles are applied via NativeWind utility classes. Theme definitions are centralized in `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Git Workflow**: All work is done on feature branches (`feature/...`) and merged into `develop` via Pull Requests.

For the complete set of rules, including directory structure and PR guidelines, please review `_docs/project-rules.md`.
