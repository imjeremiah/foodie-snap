## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Dependencies Added:**
```json
{
  "react-native-svg": "^15.x.x" // For drawing functionality
}
```

### **Image Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Base Image** → Original captured media
2. **Color Filters** → Applied using expo-image-manipulator
3. **Text Overlays** → Positioned absolutely over image (future: burned-in)
4. **Drawing Paths** → SVG paths rendered over image (future: burned-in)
5. **Final Composition** → Exported as new image URI

### **Gesture Handling:**
- **React Native Gesture Handler** for smooth drawing
- **PanGestureHandler** for drawing paths
- **Touch optimization** for mobile performance

### **State Management:**
- **Local component state** for editing operations
- **Parent state** for edited media URI
- **No Redux complexity** for creative tools

---

## 📱 Mobile Optimizations

### **Performance:**
- ✅ Lazy loading of SVG components
- ✅ Efficient gesture handling
- ✅ Optimized image compression (90% quality)
- ✅ Memory management for large images

### **UX Optimizations:**
- ✅ Touch-friendly control sizes (48px minimum)
- ✅ Scrollable tool palettes for small screens
- ✅ Visual feedback for all interactions
- ✅ Loading states during processing

### **Cross-Platform:**
- ✅ iOS and Android gesture compatibility
- ✅ Consistent color rendering
- ✅ Platform-specific UI adjustments

---

## 🚀 Integration Points

### **With Existing Systems:**

#### **Preview Screen Integration:**
```typescript
// Seamless integration with existing workflow
const currentUri = getCurrentMediaUri(); // Uses edited version if available
await sendPhotoMessage({ imageUri: currentUri, ... });
```

#### **Storage Integration:**
```typescript
// All existing storage functions work with edited media
await saveToJournal({ imageUri: editedUri, ... });
await createStory({ imageUri: editedUri, ... });
```

#### **RTK Query Integration:**
- ✅ No API changes required
- ✅ Works with existing mutation endpoints
- ✅ Maintains caching and optimization benefits

---
