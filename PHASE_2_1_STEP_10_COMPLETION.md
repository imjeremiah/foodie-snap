## Technical Architecture

### Database Enhancements (Migration 00016)
```sql
-- New columns added to messages table
ALTER TABLE public.messages 
ADD COLUMN viewed_by JSONB DEFAULT '{}',        -- Viewing tracking
ADD COLUMN screenshot_by JSONB DEFAULT '{}',   -- Screenshot tracking  
ADD COLUMN max_replays INTEGER DEFAULT 1,      -- Replay limits
ADD COLUMN viewing_duration INTEGER DEFAULT 5; -- Viewing duration
```

### Database Functions Created
1. **`record_snap_view()`** - Tracks snap views and manages replay counts
2. **`record_screenshot()`** - Records screenshot events with timestamps
3. **`can_view_snap()`** - Validates snap viewing permissions and replay limits
