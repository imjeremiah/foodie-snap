## ðŸŒµ Our SpikyPOV

**"Most social apps treat AI as a feature. We treat it as a co-pilot."**

While other apps bolt on AI capabilities as nice-to-have features, FoodieSnap is built AI-first with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) at its core. Our AI doesn't just generate captionsâ€”it learns your nutrition preferences, analyzes your meal patterns, proactively suggests content ideas, and gets smarter with every interaction. It's not a tool you use; it's a creative partner that evolves with your health journey.
