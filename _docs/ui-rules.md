# UI Design Rules for FoodieSnap

This document defines the core user interface (UI) principles and structural conventions for the FoodieSnap application. These rules are derived from our project goals, user flow, and the decision to emulate Snapchat's content-centric experience while catering to our specific niche.

---

### Core UI Principles

#### 1. Content is King

The user's photos and videos are the most important part of the app. The UI must always serve the content, not overwhelm it.

- **Minimalism**: UI elements (buttons, icons, overlays) should be clean, unobtrusive, and take up minimal screen real estate.
- **Camera-First**: The camera is the central hub of the application. The UI on the camera screen must be an overlay that provides tools without obscuring the view.
- **Edge-to-Edge Content**: Content like photos, videos, and stories should utilize the full screen whenever possible.

#### 2. Absolute Clarity & Readability

Since our app presents important nutritional data and AI suggestions, clarity is paramount.

- **High Contrast**: Text must have a high contrast ratio against its background to ensure legibility, especially for smaller text like nutritional information.
- **Clean Typography**: Use a limited set of font weights and sizes to create a clear and consistent typographic hierarchy. (Defined in `theme-rules.md`).
- **Ample Whitespace**: Use generous spacing to reduce cognitive load and help users focus on one piece of information at a time.

#### 3. Clear Hierarchy for AI Content

Users must be able to instantly distinguish between their own content, the app's UI, and AI-generated suggestions.

- **Visual Cues**: All AI-generated content (captions, prompts, "Scan-a-Snack" cards) should be visually denoted with a consistent "sparkle" ‚ú® icon.
- **Distinct Layouts**: AI suggestions should be presented in a standardized layout, such as the Bento Box model, to make them immediately recognizable.

#### 4. Fluidity & Performance

The application must feel fast, responsive, and intuitive.

- **Immediate Feedback**: Taps and gestures should have immediate visual feedback (e.g., button press states).
- **Smooth Transitions**: Screen transitions should be simple and smooth. Avoid complex animations that could cause lag on lower-end devices.
- **Loading States**: All asynchronous actions (fetching data, generating AI content) must have clear loading states (e.g., skeletons, spinners) so the user is never left guessing.

#### 5. Frictionless Creation & Feedback

The path to creating content and providing feedback to the AI should be as simple as possible.

- **One-Tap Access**: The camera must be the default screen and always be accessible via a single tap on the main navigation bar.
- **Prominent CTAs**: The primary call-to-action on any screen should be visually dominant (e.g., the "Send" button after creating a Snap).
- **Simple Feedback**: The üëç / üëé feedback mechanism for the AI must be consistently placed and require only a single tap, with a clear visual confirmation that the feedback was registered.

### Layout & Structure

#### Tab-Based Navigation

As defined in `user-flow.md`, the primary navigation will be a bottom tab bar. This provides clear, persistent access to the app's main sections.

#### The "Bento Box" UI for AI

We will use a card-based, modular grid layout‚Äîthe "Bento Box"‚Äîto display complex information generated by our AI. This promotes clarity and scannability.

- **Usage**: This layout will be used for:
  - The "Scan-a-Snack" results (modules for Macros, Ingredients, etc.).
  - The weekly "Content Spark" prompts.
  - The three AI-generated caption suggestions.
- **Design**: These cards will have defined padding, a subtle border-radius, and either a border or a soft shadow to lift them from the background, clearly grouping the related information.
